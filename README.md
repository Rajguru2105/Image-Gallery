"Welcome to my Image Gallery! This website showcases a collection of my favorite images, arranged using CSS Flexbox for a responsive and flexible layout. Flexbox allows for efficient alignment and distribution of space among items in the gallery, ensuring a visually pleasing experience on any device. Enjoy exploring my gallery!"
HTML Structure: The HTML includes a header with a title and description, and a section for the gallery items. Each image is wrapped in a div with the class gallery-item.
Flexbox Layout: The CSS uses Flexbox to create a responsive grid. The gallery class is set to display as a flex container with flex-wrap: wrap to allow items to wrap as needed. The justify-content: center centers the items within the container, and gap: 1em adds spacing between them.
